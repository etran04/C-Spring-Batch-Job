# Java-Spring-Batch-Job

## What is it?

"Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques. Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information."

## What I did

Reads a group of test scores, processes each score to its grade, and then writes the updated data into a MySQL database table.

I used the provided test case of 'scores.txt' as input for my program. It is provided under the csv folder. 
'Coding_challenge.out' is the output file from outputting the table from the MySQL database. 
The 'database.sql' is the database schema SQL produced with mysqldump.
