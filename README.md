## What is it?
Reads a group of test scores, processes each score to its grade, and then writes the updated data into a MySQL database table.

I used the provided test case of 'scores.txt' as input for my program. It is provided under the csv folder. 
'Coding_challenge.out' is the output file from outputting the table from the MySQL database. 
The 'database.sql' is the database schema SQL produced with mysqldump.
